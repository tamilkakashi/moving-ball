Bouncing Ball Animation README
Overview
This project is a simple web-based animation of a bouncing ball that moves diagonally across the screen. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it creates a visually engaging effect as the ball bounces off the edges of the window.

Features
Bouncing Ball Animation: A red ball that moves diagonally and bounces off the edges of the browser window.
Simple Controls: Automatically starts and continues the animation without user interaction.
Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to run the HTML file.
How to Use
Clone the Repository: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the HTML File: Open index.html (or whatever you've named it) in a web browser.
Watch the Animation: The ball will start moving and bouncing as soon as the page loads.
Code Structure
HTML: Contains a div element representing the ball, styled to appear circular and red.
JavaScript:
Variables: Sets the velocity and initial position of the ball, as well as the direction of movement.
Move Function: The move() function updates the position of the ball, checks for collisions with the edges, and reverses direction as necessary.
setInterval: The animation is continuously updated every 100 milliseconds.
Customization
Ball Color and Size: Change the background-color, height, and width properties in the div styles to customize the ball's appearance.
Velocity: Adjust the velocity variable to change how fast the ball moves.
Movement Range: Modify the boundary checks in the move() function to change the bouncing behavior or dimensions.
